About me:
I am 25 years old. After working in my field of study for half a year, I 
realized that I absolutely do not like this area. After that, I began to 
look for something that really resonates with me. Thus, this path led me 
to frontend development. I enjoy the results I get and the realization 
that I can create cool things on my own. And there is so much more ahead. 
I hope this course will be a good help for my further development.
