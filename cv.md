# About me:
---
_I am 25 years old. After working in my field of study for half a year, I realized that I absolutely do not like this area. After that, I began to look for something that really resonates with me. 
Thus, this path led me to frontend development. I enjoy the results I get and the realization that I can create cool things on my own. And there is so much more ahead. I hope this course will be a 
good help for my further development._
